        "abstract": "Despite its immense potential for industries and services as a promising solution for trust and transparency problems, Blockchain related studies in the field of Marketing are rare. This research mobilizes the technology acceptance Model (TAM) theory to investigate the added value of blockchain technology to online platforms while taking into consideration consumers characteristics. Data from 212 users of online platforms endowed with blockchain technology were collected. Findings demonstrate that blockchain features in terms of security and privacy enhance the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use of the online platform, leading to stronger trust and more actual transactions. In addition, results demonstrate that risk aversion weakens only the relationship between usefulness and trust. It has indeed no significant effect on the impact of ease of use on trust. Results also show that technophilia fosters the relationship between intents and actual transactions. The research provides heuristic implications for academia and industry.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Blockchain technology has fascinated researchers and industry professionals. Since its birth, the attention for blockchain has been exponentially increasing, however, most of the industries are still skeptical in adoption for value creation. The purpose of this study is to analyze the actual level of implementation and diffusion of blockchain technology within the logistics and transportation industry by comparing and using the collective intelligence of academic literature and industry practices of implementation of blockchain in this domain. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the methodology of systematic literature review along with inductive reasoning. The systematic literature review of academic and industry frontiers together has brought a bigger and real picture into consideration. Findings: The results highlight that, within the transportation sector, currently there is a very low diffusion of blockchain, although applications show immense promises for the future. The various application where blockchain technology can make a significant impact are also identified. Research limitations/implications: Due to the early stage of experimentation with blockchain technology, high-quality data which is relevant to the optimized usage of this technology in the logistics and transportation industry is not available. Practical implications: The study will help the practitioners in identifying additional avenues in which they could implement blockchain for the effectiveness, efficiency and growth of the logistics and transportation industry. Originality/value: The analysis of mixed sources of information for undertaking systematic literature review by assessing academic and trade publications is a novelty of this study.",

        "abstract": "Home delivery (B2C) experienced rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially food delivery. Nonrepudiation is a problem in security and affects delivery. Blockchain technology is a new technology that addresses this issue. This paper proposes preventing nonrepudiation in home delivery through blockchain technology. We also design a data structure and smart contract for distributed application. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in terms of transaction fees and response times. We experimented on the blockchain emulator, stored data in RDBMS, and implemented a client with a mobile application. The data in the smart contract were directly impacted by the gas used and the response time. Primarily, the function processes the large data size and involves high transaction fees and long response times. The gas used accounts for 9061 times of data length, while the response time accounts for 2.84 times of data length. Finally, we propose a security policy for the proposed framework.",

        "abstract": "The Identity Federation has been introduced as an appropriate solution to overcome cybersecurity risks via a reliable management of users identities, while enhancing usability, security, and privacy aspects. However, the interoperability has become one of the greatest challenges facing typical Identity Federations. Simultaneously, the centralization approach of the trust management in current Identity Federations is another major concern, leading to inherent deficiencies such as a central point of failure and scalability issues. In order to better deal with such a dilemma, we present in this paper an innovative framework of Attribute Aggregation within a federated Blockchain, by overcoming the major challenges related to the interoperability requirement and trust management that could reduce the attractiveness of the Identity Federation approach. The proposed system is relied mainly on the SAML standard and Smart Contracts. The experimental results show the efficiency of Fedidchain compared to centralized models of Attribute Aggregation within Identity Federations.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we present the first solution for multi-party certified email that achieves fairness and confidentiality without the intervention of a TTP but with blockchain support when problems arise. Our solution preserves the confidentiality of the mail exchanged between the sender and the recipients even when the blockchain is involved. We provide a proof of concept implementation based on Ethereum smart contracts that shows it is feasible from a practical point of view. Because the functions of a smart contract are only executed on the blockchain in the case of conflict, costs are minimised compared to solutions that execute the functions on the blockchain in all cases (on-chain solutions). Moreover, the solution can be integrated into the existing email infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) is a promising technology that aims to improve the traditional transport management systems. In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs-RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.",

        "abstract": "A smart contract (SC) is a digital negotiation protocol among two or more anonymous parties without the presence of any trusted intermediaries. It is a self-executing agreement in the form of computer code. Smart contracts run on the blockchain. Thus, the code and the agreement are stored on a distributed public database and cannot be changed. There is a broad range of prospective application scenarios for smart contracts in the digital economy, including financial services, management, healthcare, and the Internet of Things. Ethereum and Hyperledger, are two of the most widely used open-source advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. Major technical challenges such as security, privacy, correctness, and verifiability are among the issues that are yet to be matured and completely resolved for blockchain. In this work, a comprehensive survey on smart contracts is carried out. We also present a case study on a University examination system having a heterogeneous data structure. This deployment brings a comprehensive understanding of the smart contract framework and has been used to find and analyze the gaps in the state of the art in terms of smart contracts.",
